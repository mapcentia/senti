Senti - an open source project that will make Denmark smarter

In collaboration with Geo Fyn A/S has MapCentia ApS and WebHouse ApS launched the open source project Senti.

## Purpose of the project

During daily operations, planning and implementation of projects, most municipalities need to know how their facilities in a broad sense are used (eg. roads, paths, squares, halls, museums, exhibitions and events).

There is a need for knowledge about:

* How many uses the halls and when?
* How many visits museums / events and how long are they staying?
* How many people use the new staircase?
* How many people use the passage before / after renovation?
* Where does the traffic congest mostly in the morning?
* Where is it best to place benches and waste containers in the square?

The goal is to develop a system that makes it cheap and easy to put gizmos up in the city - The SmartCity. Gizmos must be equipped with various "collectors" to count and track the city's users and store data in the cloud and visualize data through maps, graphs and bar charts - a City-Dashboard.
